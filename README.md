# COMP1000 to COMP1010 Transition Workshops

We focus on the following aspects of programming -

- variables
- conditions
- loops
- functions
- arrays
- strings
- problem solving

Workshop material is provided under relevant folders.

There's no fixed agenda. Students can come and ask "can you help me with functions" or "i had trouble with arrays. can we go through that" and volunteers assist students with the same.
